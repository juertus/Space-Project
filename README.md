It contains the source code of my first game.

This game made with Godot Game Engine 4.2. 

You can download the files directly and open them in Godot. I have tried to follow the spelling rules as much as I can, but I apologize if you are still confused. 

I also didn't leave notes in my code because I didn't use any note to learn how to do this. If I can learn it, I think anyone can do it.
